Serves 2-4.

We love this locally made tofu, not too soft or firm, and very flavorful. The tofu is the star ingredient, with just a bit of pork to enhance the flavor. 



* 1 block of tofu, thickly sliced
* a handful of chinese chives, cut into 1 inch length
* 1/2 lb of pork shoulder, thinly sliced
* 1 tablespoon of soy sauce
* some white pepper
* 2 teaspoons of cornstarch
* 4 cloves of garlic, finely chopped 
* Shitake mushrooms, sliced, optional
* 1 tablespoon of oyster sauce
* 1 tablespoon of dark soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon of chinese fermented soy beans


I made this as part of my Chinese New Year dinner.
