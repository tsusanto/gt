The secret to making super crispy fried chicken wings is double frying it. Deep fry for 8 minutes or so, let it cool on a wire rack for about 5 minutes, then deep fry it again for another 5 minutes.

* 1 block of tofu, thickly sliced
* a handful of chinese chives, cut into 1 inch length
* 1/2 lb of pork shoulder, thinly sliced
* 1 tablespoon of soy sauce
* some white pepper
* 2 teaspoons of cornstarch
* 4 cloves of garlic, finely chopped 
* Shitake mushrooms, sliced, optional
* 1 tablespoon of oyster sauce
* 1 tablespoon of dark soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon of chinese fermented soy beans


I made this as part of my Chinese New Year dinner.
