The secret to making super crispy fried chicken wings is double frying it. Deep fry for 8 minutes or so, let it cool on a wire rack for about 5 minutes, then deep fry it again for another 5 minutes.

* 8 chicken wings, cut into drummette and wingnette, discard the wing tips
* store bought seasoned flour for fried chicken
* garlic salt and pepper blend (I like Kinder's brand)
* corn starch 


I enjoy grocery shopping when I travel internationally. I bought this fried chicken seasoning when I travelled to Malaysia last year. 

As much as I love fried chicken wings, I dislike deep frying inside the house as the house will smell of grease for a long time. I'm fortunate enough to have a very cool cooking setup in our backyard, which consists of a induction stovetop set on top of a dining table under our gazebo.
I use a vinyl table cloth which is easy to clean up, or I just replace it when it gets too dirty.

I made this as part of my Chinese New Year dinner.
