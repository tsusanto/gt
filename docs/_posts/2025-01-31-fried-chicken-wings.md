The secret to making super crispy fried chicken wings is double frying it. Deep fry for 8 minutes or so, let it cool on a wire rack for about 5 minutes, then deep fry it again for another 5 minutes.

* 8 chicken wings, cut into drummette and wingnette, discard the wing tips
* store bought seasoned flour for fried chicken
* garlic salt and pepper blend (I like Kinder's brand)
* corn starch 


I enjoy grocery shopping when I travel internationally. I bought some fried chicken seasoning when I travelled to Malaysia last year. You can get similar ones at most asian supermarkets here too.
