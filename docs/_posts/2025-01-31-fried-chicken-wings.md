The secret to making super crispy fried chicken wings is double frying it. Deep fry for 8 minutes or so, let it cool on a wire rack for about 5 minutes, then deep fry it again for another 5 minutes.

I enjoy grocery shopping when I travel internationally. I bought some fried chicken seasoning when I travelled to Malaysia last year. You can get similar ones at most asian supermarkets here too.

Ingredients:
* 8 chicken wings, cut into drummette and wingnette, discard the wing tips
* store bought seasoned flour for fried chicken
* garlic salt and pepper blend (I like Kinder's brand)
* corn starch 

Follow instructions on your fried chicken seasoning mix. I added extra cornstarch just before deep frying it. 
Don't overcrowed the pot. I did mine in 2 batches. 
Heat up enough oil to cover the wings, set it to 390F. I really love cooking on induction stovetop as you can easily set the temperature. 
Put half the wings into the oil gently, let it fry for about 8 minutes. Lay the wings to cool on a wire rack. I used the wire rack from the toaster oven and set it on top of 2 small bowls.
Deep fry the second batch of wings, and repeat the same step above.
Deep fry the first batch of wings for another 5 minutes, and again let it cool on a wire rack, and repeat the same with the second batch.
Serve immediately.
