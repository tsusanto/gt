Ingredients:
* 1 english cucumber
* 1 clove of garlic - minced
* 6 pieces of dried woodear mushrooms
* 2 tablespoon black chinese vinegar
* 1 tablespoon sesame oil
* 1 tablespoon low sodium soy sauce 
* 1 teaspoon korean chili powder
* a handful of cilantro - chopped
* sugar 

Note that dried woodear mushrooms expands to about 3 times its size.

Soak the woodear mushroom in water for about 10 minutes. Bring a sauce pan of water to boil, add the woodear mushroom and boil it for 5 minutes. Pat dry with paper towel and cut into thin strips.

Cut cucumbers into thin strips. Discard the cucumber seeds as they will make the salad become too watery. Sprinkle salt evenly on the cucumber strips and let it sit for about 10 minutes.

Rinse the cucumbers and use a paper towel to wrap around the cucumber strops and gently squeeze out the water.

In a glass bowl, add minced garlic, black chinese vinegar, sesame oil, soy sauce, korean chili powder, sugar to taste and mix it well.

Add cucumber strips, woodear mushroom, cilantro and mix. Refrigerate for at least an hour. Garnish with sesame seeds just before serving. Keeps well in the fridge for up to 2 days.
