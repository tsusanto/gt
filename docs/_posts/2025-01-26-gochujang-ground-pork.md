Quick and easy comfort food.

Prepare sauce in a bowl with the following:
* 1.5 tablespoons korean chili powder
* 2 tablespoons of gochujang
* 1 tablespoon soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon oyster sauce
* 1 tablespoon sugar
* 2 tablespoon mirin

 
Stir fry the following:
* 1 lb Ground pork (I like to grind pork shoulder in a food processor)
* 6 cloves of garlic - minced
* 1 inch knob  ginger - grated
* 3 stalks green onions, chopped, white part only


Heat up some oil in a pan on medium Heat.
Stir fry the pork with garlic, ginger and white parts of the green onions for about 10 minutes.
Add sauce

Garnish with sesame seeds, green parts of the green onions. 

We love to eat it with white rice and some boiled eggs.
