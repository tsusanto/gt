Our favorite tofu dish

Serves 4-6.

We love this locally made tofu, not too soft or firm, and very flavorful



* 1 block of tofu, thickly sliced
* a handful of chinese chives, cut into 1 inch length
* 1/2 lb of pork shoulder, thinly sliced
* 1 tablespoon of soy sauce
* some white pepper
* 2 teaspoons of cornstarch
* 4 cloves of garlic, finely chopped 
* Shitake mushrooms, sliced, optional
* 1 tablespoon of oyster sauce
* 1.5 tablespoon of chinese fermented soy beans


Marinate the pork with cornstarch and soy sauce, white pepper. Set aside to marinate while you prep the tofu.

Pan fry the tofu on both sides under golden brown. Remove excess oil. Using the same pan, stir fry garlic and chinese fermented soy beans for about 5 minutes. 
Add pork, mushrooms and stir fry for another 5 minutes. Add tofu and chinese chives. Add about a cup of water and oyster sauce. 
Mix it well and let it boil for about 3 minutes. The sauce should thicken up nicely, if not, add some cornstarch slurry and thicken to your liking.
