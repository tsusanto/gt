Serves 4-6.

Prepare sauce in a bowl with the following:
* 1.5 tablespoons korean chili powder
* 2 tablespoons of gochujang
* 1 tablespoon soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon oyster sauce
* 1 tablespoon sugar
* 2 tablespoon mirin

 
Stir fry the following:
* 1 lb Ground pork (I like to grind pork shoulder in a food processor)
* 6-8 cloves of garlic - minced
* 1 teaspoon of grated ginger, about a thumbsized knob
* 3 stalks green onions, chopped, white part only. Save the green parts for garnish


Heat up some oil in a pan on medium Heat.
Stir fry the pork with garlic, ginger and white parts of the green onions for about 10 minutes.
Add sauce and mix well for about 1 minute. Done!

Garnish with sesame seeds, green parts of the green onions. 

We love to eat it with white rice and some boiled eggs.
