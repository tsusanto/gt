As I enter my mid life, I want to live more intentionally and focus on things that brings me the most joy and meaning. I read a book called "Designing Your Life" by Bill Burnett and Dave Evans, and I liked how the authors broke it down into four categories - work, play, love and health to determine which of these parts of our lives do we need to pay most attention to.


January 2025 was a very fun eventful month and I can confidently say I rate myself very highly in all four areas. I want to assess my life continuously throughout this year and see what I can improve on.


## Work
I feel very fortunate to have a fully remote, very chill job that pays decently well. My coworkers and manager are very friendly and I have a lot of autonomy. Work provides a structure to my life, gives me some mental stimulation, and I like having the income. Most importantly, because I do have a job and income, I can give myself permission to have fun and spend money more freely. I have been a saver my whole life and have reached my financial goals, now I am learning how to spend money more freely and not focus on saving.
Work was uneventful in January, and that's a good thing. I am blessed.

## Play 

## Love


I thank the Universe for bringing Greg into my life. Our relationship is growing deeper and happier with each deep and not always easy discussions. And we have so much fun just being together and doing things together with other people, like playing pickleball, socializing. Life is just so more fun when we do it together.
We started off the year with a new year feast with Greg and his family on January 1. Lots of delicious food and wine and fun times. I then cooked a chinese new year feast for Greg and his family on January 29th. Greg and I then got invited to another chinese new year dinner by one of our pickleball friends.

I met up with many friends in January. My friends Eric and Fran separately took me out for a belated birthday lunch. Christina invited me over to her place for a delicious lunch she made. I attended 2 ladies pot luck parties. I met up with 3 other friends separately - Lis, Chris and Shelly and had very nice conversations with each of them. It's been a very social month! 
I am grateful for all my friends who are so willing to make time to meet up with me in person and genuinely care about me.



## Health
 

I feel excited about life, excited about what this year will bring.
