As I enter my mid life, I want to live more intentionally and focus on things that brings me the most joy and meaning. I read a book called "Designing Your Life" by Bill Burnett and Dave Evans, and I like how the authors broke it down into four categories - work, play, love and health to determine which of these parts of our lives do we need to pay most attention to.


January 2025 was a very fun eventful month and I can confidently say I rate myself very highly in all four areas. I want to assess my life continuously throughout this year and see what I can improve on.


## Work
I feel very fortunate to have a fully remote, very chill job that pays decently well. My coworkers and manager are very friendly and I have a lot of autonomy. Work provides a structure to my life, gives me some mental stimulation, and I like having the income. Most importantly, because I do have a job and income, I can give myself permission to maximize fun times and learn to spend money. I have been a saver my whole life and have reached my financial goals, now I am learning how to spend money more freely and not focus on saving.
Work was uneventful in January, and that's a good thing. I am blessed.

## Play 
I played a lot of pickleball this month. Played a lot with Greg and the regulars. A friend asked me to join his pickleball MLP team for an upcoming tournament in February and so the four of us practiced together a lot. Pickleball gives me so much joy, and I have met many wonderful people through pickleball. There are so many aspects of the game I want to work on it's a constant fun challenge to improve my pickleball skills.

I also cooked a lot of new dishes and made desserts I've never made before. I tend to make savory dishes but I am enjoying making desserts more now. Greg loves them. One of the most fun thing I made this month was a mochi waffle. 

Towards the end of January, I started this cooking website and it has also been a fun venture for me. I got inspired to create it so I can share my cooking pictures and recipes with friends and family. 

## Love
I thank the Universe for bringing Greg into my life. Our relationship is growing deeper and we both feel so much more connected with each deep and not always easy discussions. I feel safe being able to talk about my feelings and thoughts openly with Greg. And we have so much fun just being together and doing things together with other people, like playing pickleball, socializing. Life is just so more fun when we do it together.
We started off the year with a new year feast with Greg and his family on January 1. Lots of delicious food and wine and fun times. I then cooked a chinese new year feast for Greg and his family on January 29th. Greg and I then got invited to another chinese new year dinner by one of our pickleball friends.

My mom is recovering very well from her his surgery and I hope to visit my parents together with Greg this year.

I met up with many friends in January. My friends Eric and Fran separately took me out for a belated birthday lunch. Christina invited me over to her place for a delicious lunch she made. I attended 2 ladies pot luck parties. I met up with 3 other friends separately - Lis, Chris and Shelly and had very nice conversations with each of them. It's been a very social month! 
I am grateful for all my friends who are so willing to make time to meet up with me in person and genuinely care about me.



## Health
I feel pretty healthy overall. I had a comprehensive blood test done last November and everything turned out well. The only thing was my calcium level was a bit lower and I've been taking calcium supplements ever since. I play enough pickleball so I get enough cardio exercse, but I could do better on strength training. 
I try to stretch for 10 minutes every day, some days I skip it but I would like to do it consistently daily.


It's been an amazing and super fun month. I feel excited about life, just happy to be alive and I feel really grateful and blessed by the universe.
