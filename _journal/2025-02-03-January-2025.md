As I enter my mid life, I want to live a more meaningful and joyful life, to live more intentionally and focus on things that I know brings me the most joy. I once read a book called "Designing Your Life" by Bill Burnett and Dave Evans, and I liked how the authors broke it down into four categories - work, play, love and health to determine which of these parts of our lives do we need to pay most attention to.


January 2025 was a very fun eventful month and I can confidently say I rate myself very highly in all four areas.

Work
I feel very fortunate to have a fully remote, very chill job that pays decently well. My coworkers and manager are very friendly and I have a lot of autonomy. Work provides a structure to my life, gives me some mental stimulation, and I like having the income. Most importantly, because I do have a job and income, I can give myself permission to have fun and spend money more freely. I have been a saver my whole life and I am learning how to spend money now.

Play 


Love

Health
 

I feel excited about life, excited about what this year will bring.
