As I enter my mid life, I want to live a more meaningful and joyful life, to live more intentionally an prioritie on the things that brings me joy. I once read a book called "Designing Your Life" by Bill Burnett and Dave Evans, and I liked how the authors broke it down into four categories - work, play, love and health and determine which of these parts of our lives do we need to pay most attention to.


January 2025 was a very fun eventful month and I can confidently say I rate myself very highly in all four areas.
