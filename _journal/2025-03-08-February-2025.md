February 2025 was another beautiful and super fun month. I am so grateful and feel very blessed for where I am in life. February was marked by 3 main themes.

The first is the pickleball tournament my team played on February 8th. I spent the first week of February practicing a lot with my team mates.

Having a goal really brought us together, and I had so much fun just playing and hanging out with my team, and got to know them better. We won gold, which was awesome, but what truly made it so memorable was that it was really a team effort and we fought until the very end and was very supportive of each other.

I still remember all the people cheering us on, it was such an adrenalin rush that I did not sleep well that night after the tournament, and my teammates told me the same happened to them. 

I am grateful to be a member at my pickleball club, and for my friend K to recruit me to his team. This is the most fun I have ever had in pickleball.

The second theme was decluttering. As I am getting ready to move in with Greg, I got rid of so much stuff, I feel so much lighter. I have been working towards being more minimalistic, and this was a great opportunity to get rid of clothes and things I don't use anymore. My goal is to continuously declutter and be mindful of what I buy.

The third theme is trivia nights. Greg and I found another fun activity that we can do together, and we work really well as a team. Our friends told us about trivia nights at a local casino. They offer free dining credits at the casino for the top 3 teams. They have three restaurants and all have decent food with modern and hip decor. The casino opened just two years ago.

Greg and I won second place the first time we went and I've been hooked on trivia ever since. I found a YouTube trivia channel which displays the questions and answers and I play it on the TV on silent mode. Greg and I would sometimes watch one video together and try to answer the questions. I think trivia is good for our brains and might help us improve our memory. 

Trivia nights at the casino only run every Tuesday from January until April. We will try to make it as often as we can, it's a fun date night and also a good way to socialize with friends.

I lead a charmed life. Every day is focused around what fun things can I do today. What yummy food can I make and eat today. I am rich in time, my mind is peaceful, I am physically healthy, I have the most amazing partner, I have supportive friends and family. My heart feels so full and overwhelmed when I think about how blessed I am.
