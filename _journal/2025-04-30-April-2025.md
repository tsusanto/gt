I officially moved in with Greg in April. This is my permanent home now and I am loving it. My goal is to totally immerse myself in the community here and build a beautiful and fun life with Greg.

We attended all of the four tuesday trivia nights this month, out of which we placed 2nd once. We formed a team with our pickleball friends and I enjoyed getting to know them better. Trivia season for this year has ended and will resume next January.

Greg's friends from bayarea stayed with us for a night as we were all invited to a friend's 50th birthday party. We enjoyed hosting them and taking them around to see all the new home models here. Someday we would to upgrade to another brand new bigger house with a built in covered patio. For now I feel completely satisfied with our house.

We also hosted a pot luck party at our house for our pickleball friends. We also had dinner with Greg's parents, sister and her family on Easter Sunday and played speedminton in the backyard.

Thanks to my friend Rachel's daughter who added me to her Hilton friends and family account, I was able to book a hotel in the bayarea for an amazing price and spent a weekend in bayarea. I had a potluck dinner with Lis and Rachel and played a lot of pickeball at the Hub. My friend Kevin gave me both his guest passes, so sweet of him. Lis and I then pigged out at my favorite indian buffet called the Himilayan Kitchen.

April was indeed a fun month with lots of feasting.
