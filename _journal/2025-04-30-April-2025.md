April was a very fun and eventful month. I officially moved in with Greg in April. This is my permanent home now and I am loving it. My goal is to totally immerse myself in the community here and build a beautiful and fun life with Greg.

We attended all of the four tuesday trivia nights this month, out of which we placed 2nd once. We formed a team with our pickleball friends and I enjoyed getting to know them better. Trivia season for this year has ended and will resume next January.
