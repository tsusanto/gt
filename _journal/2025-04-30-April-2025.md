I officially moved in with Greg in April. This is my permanent home now and I am loving it. My goal is to totally immerse myself in the community here and build a beautiful and fun life with Greg.

We attended all of the four tuesday trivia nights this month, out of which we placed 2nd once ($50 dining credits per person), and 3rd once ($30 dining credits per person). We formed a team with our pickleball friends and I enjoyed getting to know them better. Trivia season for this year has ended and will resume next January.

Greg's friends from bayarea stayed with us for a night as we were all invited to a friend's 50th birthday party. This is the 3rd 50th birthday bash we have attended and a few more to come this year. We enjoyed hosting Juan, Sammy and their daughter and taking them around to see all the new home models here. We probably will upgrade to another brand new bigger house with a built in covered patio a few years down the road. For now I feel completely satisfied with our house.

We also hosted a last minute pot luck party at our house for our pickleball friends. It's so awesome that Greg and I have the luxury of time and space and can host parties on such short notice. On Easter Sunday we had dinner with Greg's parents, sister and her family and had a lot of fun playing speedminton in the backyard. I appreciate having his family here, everyone is so welcoming and zero drama. I always enjoy just being around them, especially with our 10 year old nephew who's such a cheerful and intelligent boy who always have lots of interesting things to say.

Thanks to my friend Rachel's daughter who added me to her Hilton friends and family account, I was able to book a hotel in the bayarea for an amazing price and spent a weekend in bayarea. We made a hotpot dinner at Rachel's place and played Rummikub with Lis, Rachel and Mike. Potluck dinner and boardgames has become a tradition with them and I always enjoy seeing them.
I also played a lot of pickleball at the Hub. I do miss the Hub a lot, it's been such a big part of my life in the bayarea. My friend Kevin gave me both his guest passes, so sweet of him.


April was indeed a fun month with lots of pickleball, social gatherings and feasting. I feel very blessed and grateful for having such a fun and easy life. Both Greg and I have fully remote chill jobs, live in a super clean minimalist house with nice friendly neighbors who like to give gardening advice, live 3 minutes away from a public pickleball court where we play at 3-4 times a week, friends and family living close by, the luxury of having time to make delicious home cooked meals almost everyday, so many more blessings which I am so grateful for.
