We had a low key family dinner celebration for our nephew's birthday. I am so thankful G's family are all local so we always have family to celebrate every birthday and holidays with. They are all very nice, soft spoken and chill people, I always enjoy spending time with them.

My new Ronbus Quanta pickleball paddle arrived. Not that it improves my game but most pickleball enthusiasts love buying new paddles, including me. I had a pretty bad fall at the pickleball court within 10 minutes of arriving at our club. I continued to play 6 games despite that and won 5 games, it was a very good and fun pickleball day.

We bought a weber mini grill a couple months ago and only used it once. We decided to grill some ribeye we bought from Costco, it was super delicious. We are so lucky to live within a 6 minute drive of Costco, and that Costco is never crazy busy. We often bump into people we know whenever we go to Costco, it's always fun to chit chat a bit.

One of the things we enjoy together is to try out new places to eat at. This week we went to a new boba place that has a instagram vibe to it. We hung out for an hour and played gin rummy. It was a pleasant weekday afternoon. We went to the grand opening of a indian pizza place and got a delicious chicken tikka pizza for 50% off. Our brother in law told us about a really good taco place inside a Shell gas station. It was pretty crowded when we went there for a weekday tuesday lunch to get their taco tuesday buy 3 get 1 free deal. The tacos were delicious! We usually don't eat out that often but this week was an exception.

We live in a smallish town with a small community feel and I really love it here. It's safe, clean and very convenient for everyday living. We often bump into people we know at random places and it's always fun to make some small talk. There isn't too much to do like in a big city but we love checking out new places together whenever one opens up.
