I am so grateful for YouTube as it is such a great resource for learning just about anything. I'm also thankful a good friend of mine added me to her YouTube premium family plan so I can watch videos without ads.

My most recent project idea is to grow bean sprouts. I watched probably 20 videos before deciding on a method. I harvested my first batch of bean sprouts on the 6th day after starting it. It was a success! I learned a couple things and will tweak it when I grow them again.  I made 2 dishes with it, stir fried bean sprouts with eggs and bean sprouts kimchi soup.

I want to learn how to grow sprouts next. Isn't it wonderful we live in a time period in which we have unlimited free access to knowledge?
