This is a very easy recipe, especially if you use store bought refrigerated biscuits.

One sausage is enough for two small servings. 

Ingredients:
* 1 pork bulk sausage in casing
* 2 tablespoon of flour
* 1 cup of milk
* salt and pepper to taste
* butter as necessary

Heat up some oil and squeeze the sausage out of it's casing. Stir fry it until cooked. If there isn't enough oil renderings, you can add some butter. Add the flour and keep stirring for 3 minutes.

Add milk and stir continuously. Season with salt and pepper. The gravy should have thickened up, you can add more milk if needed to adjust the consistency of the gravy.

Server immediately with biscuits.
