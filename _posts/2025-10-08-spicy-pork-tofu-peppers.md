We played a lot of pickleball last week, and on Friday we spent nearly four hours playing non-stop. We decided to take a few days break from pickleball. 

Over the weekend, we focused on home projects - working on the front yard and cleaning grease off our kitchen cabinets with a steam cleaner. We kept touching the once sticky cabinets and gushing over how smooth and clean it feels now.

On Sunday, we went to a Pumpkin Festival just 15 minutes from home. The weather was a perfect 72°F, and the place was packed with cheerful, smiling people. I think that our town is full of happy folks.

On Monday evening, after dinner, we took a long walk. The Harvest Moon was shining brightly and hung low in the sky. It was a beautiful, quiet, and peaceful night. As usual, we walked to the pickleball courts and chatted for a while with a few familiar faces.

This past week has felt especially relaxing and peaceful with the arrival of fall weather. We watched a Korean drama called You and Everything Else, a beautifully made series about two childhood friends and their complicated friendship. The story ends with the two taking a trip to Switzerland, where one of them—who has terminal cancer - chooses to end her life with dignity. G and I really enjoyed the show, and I highly recommend it. It's a morbid topic but G and I both agreed that we will both do it for the other if the need ever arises one day. Death is part of life, and I think it's an important topic to discuss with your partner way ahead of time. 

Maybe it's because I had a restful week, I have so many ideas what fun stuff I want to do.I want to grow edible mushrooms, grow bean sprouts, learn how to make and edit videos of our daily life, make mochi and apple pies. So many fun projects to look forward to! Life really is so good.
