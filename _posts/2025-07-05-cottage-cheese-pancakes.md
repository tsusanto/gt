This recipe makes 8 small pancakes, enough for 2 people.

* 1 egg
* 1/2 cups cottage cheese
* 1/2 tablespoon sugar
* 3/4 teaspoon baking powder
* 1/4 cup all purpose flour

neutral vegetable oil for pan frying.

Mix all ingredients well. Heat up some oil in a non stick frying pan.

Use an eating spoon to drop batter into the pan, it's easier to flip the pancakes if it's smaller, about 1.5 to 2 inches wide. 

I made a blueberry sauce to go with is using frozen blueberries and thickened slightly with some cornstarch, no sugar.
