We had such a fun and eventful weekend! On Friday evening, our club hosted a mini pickleball tournament organized by some of the members. Nine teams participated, and although the tournament wasn’t gender-restricted, only men signed up. I went to watch and cheer for G, who had joined as well. Midway through, one of the players injured his foot, and they asked me to sub in. I ended up playing two games in his place—won one, lost one—and had a great time. That’s how I became the only woman in the group photo of participants.

We’ve been members of this club for a while, but this will be our last month since we now mainly play at the other indoor pickleball club. I’m grateful for the many friendly and welcoming members here, some of whom have also joined the new club. We’ve made wonderful friends who’ve already offered to bring us in as guests anytime in the future.

We took G's mom to shop at Costco today. We then went to buy lunch at a chinese bakery/dim sum to go place and had fun choosing and pointing at stuff to the counter lady. His mom then paid for all the yummy goodies we chose, it suddenly made me feel like a kid again in a good way when my parents used to pay for things when I was a kid.

G and I went for a 8 course tasting menu at a recently opened asian fusion restaurant. We saw their advertisement on instagram. Perhaps it wasn't advertised too well, and the dinner slot was at 5 pm, but we ended up being the only customers during our 2 hour dining time, it felt like we had booked the whole restaurant for ourselves. The husband and wife owners came out to chat with us in between the courses, they brought out the chef to greet us. They were so friendly and gracious, we felt like VIPs!

The food was pretty good and very good value for the $120/person gratuity included. It was a very memorable and pleasant dining experience. We live in a smallish town and enjoy trying all the new places whenever it opens up. I'm thankful we get a new place to try every couple months as this town is growing very fast.

I am very grateful for my full time salaried, fully remote and super duper chill job. I usually work between 1 to 3 hours per day and I usually don't have any meetings on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.

We have a no camera policy at work and as long as I finish my assigned tasks, hardly anyone ever bothers me. 

This is the perfect semi-retirement job and to make things even sweeter, they recently gave me a $5K annual raise, which translate to about an extra $250/month extra after tax (California!).
