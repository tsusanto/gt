We had a very fun eventful weekend! Friday evening was a mini pickleball tournament organized by some members at our club. 9 teams participated and only guys signed up even though it was not gender restricted. I went to watch to support G as he joined too. Halfway through the tournament, one of the guys had a foot injury and they asked me to sub in. I ended up playing 2 games for him, won one and lost one. I had fun. That's how I ended up being the only female in the participants picture. 

We've been members for a while but this is our last month as members as we now play at the other indoor pickleball club. I am grateful for this club for it's super friendly and welcoming members, some of whom have also joined the other indoor pickleball club. We have made many friends who will happily bring us in as guests in the future.

We took G's mom to shop at Costco today. We then went to buy lunch at a chinese bakery/dim sum to go place. It was so sweet of his mom to pay for all the yummy goodies we bought, it made me feel like a kid in a good way.

G and I went for a 8 course tasting menu at a recently opened asian fusion restaurant. We saw their advertisement on instagram. Perhaps it wasn't advertised too well, and the dinner slot was at 5 pm, but we ended up being the only customers during our 2 hour dining time, it felt like we had booked the whole restaurant for ourselves. The husband and wife owners came out to chat with us in between the courses, they brought out the chef to greet us. They were so friendly and gracious, we felt like VIPs!

The food was pretty good and very good value for the $120/person gratuity included. It was a very memorable and pleasant dining experience.
