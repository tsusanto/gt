I often find myself in disbelief how fun and easy my life is and there is so many fun events I am looking forward to. I thank the lucky stars every day I am with Greg.

We atteneded another 50th birthday party last weekend. I enjoy meeting all of Greg's high school friends and their spouses. I find it so amazing that they have all kept in touch and still hang out regularly together all these years.
