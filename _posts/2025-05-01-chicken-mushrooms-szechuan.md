I often find myself in disbelief how fun and easy my life is. We have so much fun every day there is so many fun events I am looking forward to. I thank the lucky stars every day I am with Greg.

May will be a very eventful and fun month for sure. Greg made a reservation at a very cool upscale but not pretentious restaurant where we get to tour the kitchen and get to eat unlimited amount of whatever food they prepare for us. It's such a cool concept and I know it won't be the last time we go to that restaurant.

We will also be hosting two lunch parties at home and I have been busy brainstorming for what dishes I am going to make for the parties.

We attended another 50th birthday party last weekend. I enjoy meeting all of Greg's high school friends and their spouses. I find it so amazing that they have all kept in touch and still hang out regularly together all these years.
