Greg and I went to a trivia night with some friends and we had such a blast. Our friends formed their own team. We won second place and received a $100 in dining credits. We were so shocked when they announced that "Shadow Ninjas", which is our team name, got second place. I'm so proud of us.

Some fun questions. What do you call a female elephant? What causes Mars to look reddish? 

We have an abundance of very healthy mint growing in our raised vegetable bed. I've been looking to use it in my cooking, and came up with this dish which uses a lot of mint instead of the usual thai basil.

Ingredients:
* 1 lb of ground chicken 
* 1/2 onion - chopped
* 2 cloves garlic - minced
* sweet bell peppers
* 2 tablespoons oyster sauce
* 2 tablespoons dark soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon sugar
* 2 thai chilli, finely chopped
* salt and white pepper 
* generous amount of mint leaves, coarsely chopped

Heat up some oil in a pan, add ground chicken. Stir fry for 5 minutes until the grease of the chicken comes out. 

Add garlic, onion, bell peppers, thai chilli, oyster sauce, dark soy sauce and sugar. Stir fry for another 10 minutes. This process takes a while so be patient. We want most of the sauce to evaporate. 

Add salt and pepper to taste. 

Add the mint leaves and give it a quick stir and turn off the heat. Garnish with a few fresh mint leaves. Serve immediately with white rice.
