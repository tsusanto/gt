I like using "New York Style Sausage Company" [brand](https://newyorkstylesausage.com/product/hot-italian-sausage/){:target="_blank"}

Stir fry sliced onions for a few minutes. Add sliced bell peppers, garlic, sausages. Add a can of diced tomatoes, 1 tablespoon of tomato paste, chili flakes. Salt and pepper to taste.

We like it as a sandwich.
