I told G I want to start making meals the japanese way called ichiju sanchai, which consists of a main dish, two side dishs and one soup. So G found these very beautiful bento plates from Crate and Barrel and I am absolutely thrilled with it. Eating dinner out of a ceramic plate defintely feels better than eating out of a plastic bento box. He's always so supportive of whatever whims I have. 

I am super excited and so thankful an indoor pickleball court finally opened up in our town. G and I play so much pickleball and we both hate being in the sun. This place has AC, open all day everyday, this is going to make such a positive impact in our lives.
