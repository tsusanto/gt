Cut lamb shoulder into small cubes. Marinate with shaoxing wine, soy sauce, white pepper, salt and cumin for about 20 minutes.

Dice half a red bell pepper, cut scallions into small sections.

Toast some cumin seeds and set aside. Stir fry the lamb on high heat until almost cooked. Set lamb aside. Add more oil to the pan, stir fry bell pepper, crushed szechuan peppercorns, scallions for about 2 minutes. Add lamb to the pan, a teaspoon of sugar and some dark soy sauce. Mix well and garnish with cilantro.
