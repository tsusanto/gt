This dish is inspired by Singaporean claypot chicken rice. I made this using just one pot which makes for easy cleanup.

Ingredients:
* 2 chinese sausage
* 6 dried mushrooms - soaked in hot water, sliced
* 

Cut the chicken into pieces and marinate it with white pepper, dark soy sauce, soy sauce and brown sugar for 10 minutes.
