I enjoy soy milk, especially with chinese fried doughnut dipped in it.

I got inspired to make my own when I visited a friend and she showed me her Joyoung soy milk maker. The soy milk was absolutely delicious, very flavorful and very creamy.

I don't drink enough soy milk to justify an expensive machine but was curious if I could make it at home. I'm pretty happy with the results.

Ingredients:
* 1 cup of dried soy beans, soaked 24 hours
* 4 cups of water
* rock sugar to taste
* pandan leaves, optional

Blend the drained soy beans with 4 cups of water, then filter the milk with a mesh strainer directly into a sauce pan. 

Add rock sugar according to taste. I also added some frozen pandan leaves for extra flavor, but this is totally optional.

Boil the soy milk on low heat, stir constantly. Make sure to stir the bottom of the pan to prevent burning. Skim off the foam. 

The milk tends to boil over and I just lift the sauce pan briefly then set it back on the stove.

Cook it for about 20 minutes.

I then further strained the milk by pouring it through a coffee filter set inside a pour over coffee cone straight into my serving mugs.
