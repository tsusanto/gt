I woke up this morning well rested and feeling content. Our house is such a joy to wake up to, always at a comfortable temperature thanks to great insulation, and Greg always keeps it so clean and clutter free. I often start my day with a 10 minute meditation, and some stretching in our living room.

We are both lucky to have fully remote chill jobs, which means we rarely feel rushed for the entire day, every day. I have the time to cook healthy delicious meals in either our clean spacious kitchen or backyard kitchen.  All these to me, is true luxury.

I feel so blessed and grateful for all the good things in our lives.

We overindulged last night on the pork belly with ssamjang wraps and beer, today a simple tofu soup with vegetables seemed like the perfect little lunch. 

I love this locally made tofu, it's sold in a plastic bag filled with water, not too firm or soft, and very good tofu flavor. You can adjust the amount of the vegetables per your liking.

Ingredients:
* 1 pack of tofu 
* dashi packet (I use Kayanoya brand)
* daikon
* crysanthemum greens (tong ho)
* green onions
* white pepper 
* dried seaweed 

Boil some water with the dashi packet for 5 minutes. Discard the dashi packet. Add the rest of the ingredients, add salt and pepper to taste.
