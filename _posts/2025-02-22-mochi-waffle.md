Today felt like such a productive day even though we only spent 1 hour on it. 

Greg and I built a metal rack for our garage, and moved all the stuff we had lying on the floor and neatly organized them on the rack. We then stood there together for a good full minute and admired our work, then looked at each other, smiled and did a silent high five.

Some things are just so much easier when done as a team.

We then decided we deserved a sweet treat for having worked so hard.


Ingredients:
* 1 cup glutinous rice flour
* 1/4 cup all purpose flour
* 1.5 teaspoon baking powder
* 2 tbsp sugar
* 1 tsp salt
* 3/4 cup milk 
* 1 egg
* 1 tsp vanilla extract

Whisk the egg, milk, vanilla extract ingredients in a bowl. In a separate bowl, mix the glutinous rice flour, all purpose flour, salt, sugar and baking powder. Add wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, mix well using a fork.

Brush the waffle maker with some melted butter. Pour batter and cook for 3 minutes or until golden brown.

We like to eat it with ice cream, whipped cream and fresh fruit.
