I found this pack of knife cut noodles in the refrigerator section of our local asian grocery store and is in love with it. The texture is chewy and takes less than 5 minutes to cook. Right now it's priced at $3.99, I wonder how much it will cost after the tariffs are put into place if Trump does not change his mind yet again.

This is a great way to use up all the vegetables you have leftover. 

Ingredients:
* 2 bundles of knife cut noodles
* ground beef
* 4 cloves of garlic minced
* mushrooms, snowpeas, red sweet chili, carrots, green bell pepper, green onions, any vegetables
* Sauce - 1 tblsp sesame oil, 3 tblsp light soy sauce, 1 tblsp dark soy sauce, 2 tblsp oyster sauce, 2 tsp sugar, 1 tblsp korean chili powder , chicken bouillon powder
* black pepper, salt to taste

Make sauce in a bowl. Marinate ground beef with minced garlic and 2 tablespoons of the sauce for 15 minutes.

Cook noodles according to directions and drain.

Heat up 3 tablespoons of oil in a frying pan, stir fry marinated ground beef until it's cooked. Add all the vegetables and stir fry for 5 minutes. Add cooked noodles and sauce and stir fry for 2-3 more minutes.

Garnish with chopped green onions and/or cilantro.
