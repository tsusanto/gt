I found this pack of knife cut noodles in the refrigerator section and is in love with it. The texture is chewy and takes less than 5 minutes to cook. Right now it's priced at $3.99, I wonder how much it will cost after the tariffs are put into place if Trump does not change his mind yet again.

This is a great way to use up all the vegetables you have leftover. 

Ingredients:
* 2 bundles of knife cut noodles
* ground beef
Make sauce using these:
* 1 tablespoon sesame oil
* 3 tablespoon light soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon dark soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon oyster sauce
* 2 teaspoons sugar
* 4 cloves of garlic minced
* chicken bouillon powder
* black pepper, salt to taste
