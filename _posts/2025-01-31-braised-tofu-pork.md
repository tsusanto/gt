Serves 2-4.

We love this locally made tofu, not too soft or firm, and very flavorful. The tofu is the star ingredient, with just a bit of pork to enhance the flavor. 



* 1 block of tofu, thickly sliced
* a handful of chinese chives, cut into 1 inch length
* 1/2 lb of pork shoulder, thinly sliced
* 1 tablespoon of soy sauce
* some white pepper
* 2 teaspoons of cornstarch
* 4 cloves of garlic, finely chopped 
* Shitake mushrooms, sliced, optional
* 1 tablespoon of oyster sauce
* 1 tablespoon of dark soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon of chinese fermented soy beans


Marinate the pork with cornstarch and soy sauce, white pepper. Set aside to marinate while you prep the tofu.

On medium heat and a generous amount of oil, pan fry the tofu on both sides under golden brown, about 5 minutes on each side. Remove excess oil. Using the same pan, stir fry garlic and chinese fermented soy beans for about 2 minutes. 
Add pork, mushrooms and stir fry for another 5 minutes. Add tofu and chinese chives. Add about a cup of water and dark sauce and oyster sauce. 
Gently mix it well so you don't break the tofu, and let it boil for about 3 minutes. The sauce should thicken up nicely, if not, add some cornstarch slurry and thicken to your liking.


Serve it with steamed white rice
