Ingredients:
* 1/2 lb ground pork

I found these adorable mini lasagna pasta at Winco. I love going to Winco for its bulk section as I can try out new ingredients in small quantities. 

You can totally adjust the amount of the ingredients, if you like more cheese, by all means pile on the cheese.

Boil the pasta al dente and set it aside. Stir fry the italian sausage until cooked, drain excess oil.

Layer an oven proof pan with the marinara sauce, then add half the pasta, and half the italian sausage. Add ricotta cheese and spinach, and pour more marinara sauce over it. 
Add remaining sausage, pasta and mozzarella cheese. Top it with marinara sauce. Spread the sauce around to cover all the ingredients. Sprinkle dried oregano on top. 

Cover pan with aluminium foil, bake at 375F for 30 minutes. Remove foil and bake for another 15 minutes.
