We had a huge success with our two cherry tomato plants this year, I've been able to harvest a pound of tomatoes every other day. They are very flavorful and I use it in my cooking everyday. 

We redid our backyard last year and put in one vegetable planter, it was a fun team effort in designing and hiring contractors to build it. G and I make a great team and I'm so thankful we work so well together.
