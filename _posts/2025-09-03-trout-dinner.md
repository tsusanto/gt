G and I have both never leased cars before, but with the recent rebates and amazing lease deals, we decided to lease a new electric Hyundai Ioniq for 3 years. 

The total lease cost works out to be $4100 per year, which is less than the annual depreciation of our Lexus gas car. 

We both love the car, it's quiet, very comfortable, has lots of safety features and has a huge screen for mapa navigation. I am not a car person, but I must say this car has really made everyday driving so much more enjoyable.

Material things alone cannot make us happy, but it sure can bring us some bits of happiness in our daily life. I feel so thankful and happy every time I get into the car. 

I enjoy personal finance so did some math on the car. A gasoline car takes about one gallon to drive 25 miles, with the current gas prices, it will cost $4.50 to drive 25 miles. We charge our car at home during off peak times. It takes about 7 kwh to drive 25 miles so it will cost us about $1 to drive that distance.

Not only are we saving money with this Hyundai Ioniq, we both much prefer driving and riding this car than the Lexus gas car.
