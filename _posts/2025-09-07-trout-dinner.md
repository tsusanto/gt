My nephew just moved to Denver for his first job out of college, and my sister went to help him settle into an apartment downtown.

I flew in for the weekend to visit them and had a wonderful time. My sister and I spent an entire day exploring downtown Denver—admiring street murals, having breakfast at Denver Central Market, enjoying beer at an outdoor garden, and riding the free downtown bus to check out whatever caught our eye. By the end of the day, we had walked over 19,000 steps!

The next day, my nephew, his girlfriend, my sister, and I drove about an hour to Colorado Springs to visit Garden of the Gods. It was such a pleasant day spent with family. I’m very proud of my nephew for landing a job in such a tough market. He never gave up, applying to hundreds of positions before finally succeeding.

I don’t get to see my siblings and parents often, but I’m so thankful for them—and grateful knowing they’re always there for me if I need them.
