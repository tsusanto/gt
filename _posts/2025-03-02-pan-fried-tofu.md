Greg and I overindulged on food this past weekend. We spent the $100 dining credits from winning trivia night last Tuesday at a fancy Chinese restaurant on Friday. After dinner, we decided to burn off some of the calories and played some late night pickleball. We did not partner together but we both played pretty well and had fun in our own games.

Then on Saturday we went to a house dinner pot luck party and drank lots of wine and ate lots of delicious food. 

Today was just a chill Sunday. It started raining late afternoon, and I made a couple of vegetable dishes for dinner to go with a little bit of the slow smoked pork we packed home from the party. 
 
Ingredients:
* 1 pack tofu - thickly sliced
* 1 clove garlic - finely minced
* 2 tablespoons low sodium soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon rice vinegar
* 1 tablespoon gochugaru
* 1 teaspoon sugar
* 1 tablespoon sesame oil
* green onions - chopped
* ponzu sauce 


Make the sauce using garlic, rice vinegar, soy sauce, gochugaru, sugar, sesame oil, green onions.

Pan fry the tofu for about 3-5 minutes on each side until it's golden brown. Transfer the tofu to a serving plate.

Spoon the sauce on top of the tofu. Just before serving, pour some ponzu sauce to the bottom of the plate.
