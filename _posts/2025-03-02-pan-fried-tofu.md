Greg and I overindulged on food this past weekend. We had $100 dining credits from winning trivia night last Tuesday and we used it for our Saturday date night at a fancy chinese restaurant. We decided to burn off some of the calories and played some late night pickleball. Super fun games.

Then on Saturday, we went to a house dinner pot luck party and drank lots of wine and ate lots of delicious food.

Today was just a chill Sunday, and we wanted a lighter dinner with more vegetables and less meat.
