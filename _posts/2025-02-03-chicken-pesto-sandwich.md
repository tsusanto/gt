I love grocery shopping, and I am a big fan of Trader Joe's. I'm thankful we live 5 minutes away from one. 

With the exception of sliced olives, all the ingredients for this sandwich were bought at Trader Joe's. 


Ingredients:
* 4 chicken thighs (bone in, skin on from Trader Joe's)
* 4 Trader Joe's brioche buns
* Arugula 
* Trader Joe's pesto basil
* 2 roma tomatoes, sliced
* sliced olives
* 4 sliced cheese (provolone/swiss/cheddar)
* Italian seasoning, pepper, salt, olive oil

Debone the chicken thighs and discard the skin. I like to save the bones and freeze it in a ziploc bag for making chicken stock as we love eating noodle soups.

Marinate the chicken with italian seasoning, salt, pepper and olive oil for 10 minutes.

Heat up a grill pan. When the pan is hot, add the chicken pieces and grill for 8 minutes on each side.

Let the chicken cool before dicing it.

Broil the brioche buns face up with the sliced cheese laid on top of the bottom half of the buns. Take it out when the cheese has melted a little.

Add sliced olives on top of the cheese. Top it with arugula and sliced tomatoes.

On the top half of the buns, spread a generous amount of basil pesto, add the diced chicken and push the buns together.  

Heat up the same grill pan again using medium heat. Place the sandwich in the pan and flatten it with a spatula or use the back of a plate. Flip over after 2 minutes and heat up the other side for another 2 minutes.
