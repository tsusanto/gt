I am so grateful for having a peaceful, always clean and clutter free living room with a 65 inch Samsung frame TV to enjoy watching animes. I typically watch one episode per day in the afternoon, each episode is about 20 minute long. I subscribe to CrunchyRoll for $8/month, which I think is an amazing value.

G is very good and cleaning and living in such a clean and minimalist home really makes me feel peaceful everyday. We both do not like displaying knicks knacks. Anything that takes up visual space must be either useful or asthetically pleasing.  

This ground beef japanese curry with roasted vegetables was inspired by an anime called "Yotsuiro Biyori". It's a slice of life anime about four guys who run a traditional japanese cafe. It's very relaxing to watch the show, there's not much of a storyline, it's mostly watching them cook and serve customers in their cafe. 

We love this cinnamon orange tea we bought from a store called Market Spice in Pike Place Market in Seattle. The natural sweetness comes from the cinnamon, no sugar necessary. G and I visited Seattle in June for my nephew's college graduation ceremony and took the opportunity to check out Seattle downtown.

Another exciting event, we just leased a new electric Hyundai Ioniq 5 SEL.

G and I have both never leased cars before, but with the recent rebates and amazing lease deals, we decided to lease one for 3 years. 

The total lease cost works out to be $4100 per year, which is less than the annual depreciation of our Lexus gas car. 

We both love the car, it's quiet, very comfortable, has lots of safety features and has a huge screen for map navigation. I am not a car person, but I must say this car has really made everyday driving so much more enjoyable.

Material things alone cannot make us happy, but it sure can bring us some bits of happiness in our daily life. I feel so thankful and happy every time I get into the car. 

I enjoy personal finance so did some math on the car. A gasoline car takes about one gallon to drive 25 miles, with the current gas prices in California, it will cost $4.50 to drive 25 miles. We charge our car at home during off peak times. It takes about 7 kwh to drive 25 miles so it will cost us about $1 to drive that distance.

Not only are we saving money with this Hyundai Ioniq, we both much prefer driving and riding this car than the Lexus gas car.

We were taking a walk around our neighborhood one evening and we saw a big tractor just parked there and no one else was around. Lots of new housing are being built around us and this tractor was just left there by the builders. I love it that G and I can find fun in many things. We took the opportunity to take turns to climb into the tractor and take pictures. The sunset light was beautiful and I have very fond memories being silly with G.
