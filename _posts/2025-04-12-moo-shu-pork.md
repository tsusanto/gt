We hosted a party last Saturday for our pickleball friends, 10 people showed up. It was a fun afternoon of eating, boardgames followed by pickleball at the park nearby to burn off all those calories.

I made mango and jicama salad for the party, and was wondering how to use up the leftover jicama. 

This dish is inspired by moo shu pork but I used jicama in place of cucumbers, and I actually prefer jicama much better.

Ingredients:
* pork - thinly sliced
* jicama - thinly sliced
* carrots - thinly sliced
* black woodear mushrooms - chopped
* snow peas - cut in half
* 2 eggs - beat
* 4 cloves of garlic - thinly sliced
* sauce - 1 tblsp sesame oil, 1 tblsp light soy sauce, 1 tblsp dark soy sauce, 1 tblsp oyster sauce, 2 tblsp shaoxing wine, chicken bouillon powder
* black pepper, salt to taste

Make sauce in a bowl.

Marinate pork with 1 tablespoon of the sauce for 15 minutes.

Heat up 2 tablespoons of oil in a frying pan, cook the eggs and let it set, then break it into smaller pieces with the spatula, set eggs aside. 

Add more oil to the pan, stir fry garlic for a minute and add marinated pork and cook until pork is cooked, set aside. 

Stir fry all the vegetables for 5 minutes, add remaining sauce, pork and eggs and stir fry for another minute.
