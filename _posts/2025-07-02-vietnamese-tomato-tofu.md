I used our super flavorful homegrown red cherry tomatoes for this dish.

Pan fry firm tofu on both sides, set aside.

Heat up some oil, stir fry minced garlic and chopped onions for a minute, add ground pork and cook until pork is browned. Add soy sauce, fish sauce, oyster sauce, dark soy sauce and mix well. Set pork aside. 

Add about 1 lb of tomatoes to the same pan, cook until tomatoes turn into sauce, add some water if necessary. Add tofu and pork back to the pan and mix well. Add sugar and salt to taste.

Stir in a generous amount of chopped green onions, serve with steamed rice.
