Marinate a slab of pork with soy sauce, oyster sauce, palm sugar, fish sauce, vegetable oil, baking soda, dark soy sauce, minced garlic, minced cilantro stems and roots for 30 minutes. Bake at 375F for 25 minutes. 

Broil on both sides to get a bit of char.

Make sauce with tamarind juice, palm sugar, fish sauce, thai roasted chili powder, roasted rice powder, lime juice. Cut up fresh ingredients - shallots, deseeded thai chili, cilantro, green onions, mint, kaffir lime leaves.

When pork has cooled down, cut into thin slices, mix well with sauce.

Toss pork with all the fresh ingredients. Tastes great at room temperature.
