I had a pretty perfect well balanced day today. Had a good night's rest, did some work, went for my favorite dance fitness class then made lunch. Worked a little bit more, meditated, did a quick stretch then an hour nap. Greg and I went to play pickleball, I had some very fun ladies games. Then I made a yummy dinner and we watched half a movie on Netflix. 


I love fresh plump shiitake mushrooms. I get them at our local asian grocery store, and they always carry these fresh flower top shiitake mushrooms, which has white cracks in the mushroom caps. They are thicker and absorb flavors better than the regular shiitake mushrooms which you find at Costco.


Ingredients:
* 8-10 fresh shiitake mushrooms
* 1 clove garlic - finely minced
* 2 tablespoons low sodium soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon rice vinegar
* 1 tablespoon gochugaru
* 1 teaspoon sugar
* 1 tablespoon sesame oil
* green onions - chopped
* ponzu sauce 


Make the sauce using garlic, rice vinegar, soy sauce, gochugaru, sugar, sesame oil, green onions.

Pan fry the tofu for about 3-5 minutes on each side until it's golden brown. Transfer the tofu to a serving plate.

Spoon the sauce on top of the tofu. Just before serving, pour some ponzu sauce to the bottom of the plate.
