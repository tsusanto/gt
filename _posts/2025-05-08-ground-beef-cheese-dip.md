Stir fry chopped onions, ground beef and taco seasoning until browned. Set aside. Add some butter if there isn't enough fat renderings from the beef, add a tablespoon of flour. Stir continuously on low heat. Add some milk. Add cooked beef and onion back to the pot. Add a can of diced tomatoes with green chilli, add shredded cheese. Mix everything until cheese is melted. 
Transfer to a crockpot on warm setting and serve with tortila chips or sliced french bread.
