Ingredients:
* snow peas
* 3 cloves of garlic - minced
* low sodium soy sauce 
* oyster sauce

This is my favorite way to prepare greens. 

I use this method for sugar snap peas, yu choy, broccoli, napa cabbage, green cabbage, romaine lettuce and many other greens. 

Heat up 2 tablespoon of oil in a pan, add garlic and stir fry for a minute. Add snap peas and stir fry for a minute. Add equal parts of soy sauce and oyster sauce and mix well. Add some water if it looks too dry and stir fry for another minute. Serve immediately.

We like our vegetables crunchy so I don't cook it for too long.
