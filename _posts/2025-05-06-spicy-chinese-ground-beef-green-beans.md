I love using Trader Joe's frozen french haricot beans for this dish. It's very convenient and tastes as good as fresh beans.

Blanch frozen beans in boiling water for 1-2 minutes. Drain and set aside.

Chop garlic. Cut beans into half inch lengths. Chop one deseeded thai chili. Dice half a red bell pepper.

Stir fry garlic and thai chili in oil, add ground beef, dark soy sauce, szechuan chili oil, a bit of sugar and salt to taste. Add red bell peppers and stir fry for another few minutes. 

Add blanched green beans and stir fry for a minute.
