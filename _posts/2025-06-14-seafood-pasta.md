I made the tomato sauce using our very flavorful home grown cherry tomatoes.

Stir fry chopped garlic, onions and red pepper flakes in olive oil. Add 2 pounds of cherry tomatoes, water or white wine or chicken broth, cook it down until the sauce thickens. Add 1 tablespoon of tomato paste.

Add your choice of seafood to the sauce and boil until cooked. Add a generous amount of fresh parsley and stir for another minute. Serve with pasta.
