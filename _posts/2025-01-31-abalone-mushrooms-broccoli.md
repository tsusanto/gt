Serves 2-4.

I made this dish for the first time as part of my Chinese New Year dinner I made for G and his family


* 1 can of lee kum kee abalone, 6 whole abalones in it
* a big crown of broccoli - cut into florets
* 10 fresh shitake mushrooms - thinly sliced
* 2 cloves of garlic - minced
* 1 tablespoon of dark soy sauce
* 2 teaspoons of cornstarch
* 4 cloves of garlic, finely chopped 
* salt, sugar and pepper to taste


Boil water with some salt, and blanch the broccoli. I like my broccoli on a bit crunchy which takes only 90 seconds or so to cook. Soak the blanched broccoli in a bowl of ice water for 2 minutes. Arrange the broccoli on a plate in a circle.

Slice the abalones and set it aside, save all the sauce from the canned abalone.

In a pan on medium heat, heat 2 tablespoons of oil, stir fry the minched garlic for about a minute. Add sliced shitake mushrooms, dark soy sauce and some water, stir fry for about 5 minutes. Add more water if it looks too dry. 
  
Add all canned abalone sauce, let it boil for 2 minutes. Season with salt, white pepper and some sugar. Add the sliced abalones and let it boil for another minute. Add some cornstarch slurry to thicken the sauce.

Pour the sauce over the broccoli.
