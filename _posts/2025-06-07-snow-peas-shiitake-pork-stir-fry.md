I often make stir fry of different variations. This is one of our favorites.

Marinate thinly sliced pork in soy sauce, corn starch, salt and pepper.

Stir fry chopped garlic, dried chili, pork, thinly sliced shiitake mushrooms, fry for 3 minutes. Add dark soy sauce, oyster sauce. 

Add snow peas, stir fry for another minute. Add shaoxing wine. Serve with steamed white rice.
