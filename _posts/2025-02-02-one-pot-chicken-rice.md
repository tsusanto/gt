Serves 2-4

This dish is inspired by Singaporean claypot chicken rice. I made this using just one pot which makes for easy cleanup.

Ingredients:
* 2 chinese sausage
* 6 dried mushrooms - soaked in hot water, sliced
* 1.5 cup of white rice - washed
* 2 chicken wings/chicken thighs
* dark soy sauce
* sesame oil
* soy sauce
* 1 inch of ginger root - thinly sliced
* 4 cloves of garlic - finely chopped
* cilantro 
* brown sugar
* white pepper

Cut the chicken into pieces and marinate it with white pepper, dark soy sauce, soy sauce and brown sugar for 10 minutes.

In a non stick pan on medium heat, heat up some oil. Stir fry ginger slices and garlic for a minute, add the marinated chicken, mushrooms and chinese sausage. Stir fry for about 5 minutes.

Transfer the chicken to a plate, it's ok if it's not fully cooked as we will cook it again together with the rice.

In the same pan, put in the rice and stir fry it. Add some water and sesame oil. Stir fry for about 5 minutes.

Add 2 cups of water to pan and close the lid. Make sure your lid has a hole for the steam to escape. I like using a glass lid so I can see through it.

After 5 minutes, open the lid and add the chicken on top of the rice. Add more water if it seems too dry. Close the lid and let it cook for another 15 minutes under low heat.

Turn off the stove and let the chicken rice sit with the lid on for another 10 minutes.

Open the lid and immediately pour some dark soy sauce, sesame oil, salt and white pepper. Give it a good mix and garnish with cilantro.

I like to eat it with a dipping sauce made of sliced thai chili and soy sauce.
