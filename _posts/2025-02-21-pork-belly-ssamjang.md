This is a super fun dinner to eat, and very easy too. The combination of the fattiness of the pork, the salty umami ssamjang dipping sauce, refreshing lettuce leaves, sour kimchi and the neutralness of rice to balance it off, it's sheer bliss.

Greg and I partnered up to play pickleball together and we both were playing pretty badly. It was frustrating. I am grateful though that we are very supportive of each other when we play together, regardless of whether we played well or not. 

We got home and made this dinner, and decided we deserve to have some beer. Greg put on some chill vibes music, toasted each other with our beers and happily munched away on our pork belly wraps. Life is good and we are so blessed.
