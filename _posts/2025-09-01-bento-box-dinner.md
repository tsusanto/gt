* pan fried tofu with spicy ground beef
* long green beans with spiced tofu and cherry tomatoes
* marinated bean sprouts 
* tofu with cabbage soup

I bought some bento boxes on a whim and decided to use it for dinner at home, it was fun to eat out of a bento box.

I'm really grateful to have nice neighbors. One of them gave us a big bunch of yard long beans they grew in their backyard and I used it in tonight's dinner.

We had a huge success with our two cherry tomato plants this year, I've been able to harvest a pound of tomatoes every other day. They are very flavorful and I use it in my cooking everyday. 

We redid our backyard last year and put in one vegetable planter, it was a fun team effort in designing and hiring contractors to build it. G and I make a great team.
