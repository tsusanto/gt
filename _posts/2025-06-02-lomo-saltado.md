Air fry or bake frozen french fries according to instruction.

Marinate flank steak with kinder's salt, garlic and pepper blend, parsley and lemon for 1 hour. Broil in toaster oven for 3 minutes on each side. Let it rest and cut into small cubes.

Make sauce using hot chili sauce, white vinegar, soy sauce. 

Stir fry yellow cherry tomatoes (I used my homegrown sun gold cherry tomatoes) in oil until it's soft. Add sliced onions, red cherry tomatoes, beef and stir fry for a minute on high heat. Add sauce, mix well, add cornstarch slurry, mix well and serve it on top of the fries. Garnish with parsley or cilantro.
