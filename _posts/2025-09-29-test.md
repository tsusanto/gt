I posted a detailed 7 day food journal about 3 months ago, you can check my post history. 

This time I decided to post our total food bill for the month and write about some notable food highlights.

We are a household of 2 adults, 47F and 50M. No kids, no pets. I won't go into too much details but we are comfortably FI and choose to work because both of us have fully remote jobs and we both work only 1-3 hours per day.

Our daily life is very peaceful and stress free. I enjoy cooking, grocery shopping which I think of as a separate hobby, pickleball, napping and watching anime and exploring new places to eat with him. 

Today as I'm writing this, it's almost noon and I'm done with work already, rarely anyone messages me at work. My tennis elbow feels pretty bad today or I would go have gone to play pickleball right after lunch.

For the month we spent $511 on grocery and $511 eating out, for a grand total of $1,018.

I think we eat very well and I know our grocery bill is relatively low. I am a very good shopper, I buy in bulk and buy items on sale. I cook without recipes and can come up with dishes based on what ingredients I have, so I rarely waste food. I consider it my secret skill.

## Eating Out - $511
We usually spend about $150 per month eating out as I cook almost everyday, but this month is quite unusual, we spent $511. We ate out 6 times and bought some treats to go. 

We splurged on a 8 course chef tasting menu for $120/person. It was a very memorable experience and the restaurant owners (husband and wife team) came to chat with us in between the courses and brought the chef out to greet us. We felt like VIPs!

I recently discovered an app called "Too Good To Go (TGTG)", through which you can buy the leftover food of the day from bakeries and restaurants. I love the thrill of finding a good deal (hard habit to kick from my money saving days) and wanted to try every place that was available close to me. I made 4 TGTG orders this month. My favorite is from a dim sum place from which I got 3 orders of dim sum items for $6. Peets coffee is pretty decent too, 5 pastries for $4. I probably will not do it too often anymore now that I know what it's about and it's definitely not good for our waistlines.
 
A friend came to visit from out of town and we had dinner at an all you can eat korean bbq. It was delicious and well worth the money at $33/person. We ordered some beer too.

An indian pizza place just opened up and they had 50% off on their grand opening day. We ordered Chicken Tikka Pizza and we really enjoyed it.

Here are all our eating out items for the month:
- 4 orders of too good to go (bakery treats)
- all you can eat korean bbq and beer
- lunch at a vietnamese restaurant
- boba 
- indian pizza and mango lassi
- 8 course chef tasting menu 
- 2 outings of sandwich and fries


## Grocery - $508
I counted all the credit card grocery store vists and we made 30 visits to the grocery stores this month! 

The stores include Safeway, Trader Joes, Costco, Winco, an Asian grocery store and a couple more random stores. 

We live within a 10 minute drive to many grocery stores, and most of them are on the way to our pickleball club, which we go to 4-5 times a week. So we will often pick up a few items on the way back home after a pickleball session. I often will make a quick run to Safeway to pick up a few items as it's just a 3 minute drive from our house. 

$508 is pretty in line with what we spend each month on grocery. I just checked the freezer and it's packed full of meat. I think our grocery bill next month will be a lot lower.

I've been doing the japanese way of eating, which is called ichiju sansai, or 3 dishes and 1 soup, mostly eaten with rice. Our meals feel so much fancier and it also helps with portion control. We are also eating less meat and more vegetables because of this style of eating. Hot soup helps makes us feel fuller.  We are going to Asia in a few months and I plan to buy lots of pretty japanese style plates and bowls.
