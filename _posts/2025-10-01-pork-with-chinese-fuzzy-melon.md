* Braised pork with chinese fuzzy melon
* oyster mushrooms in miso butter sauce
* miso soup with tofu and seaweed
* kimchi (from Costco)

We ended our membership at the sports club and is now playing pickleball almost exclusively at the newly opened indoor pickleball club. We had a great time at the sports club and I'm thankful for all the happy memories there.

We have already made friends with a regular group of folks and I'm so grateful for this friendly community.

Yesterday someone organized a surprise noon birthday party for one of the members and we were invited. I grilled some lemongrass tri tip to bring to the party.

Today is the first heavy rain of the fall season. I often feel wistful when summer ends. How did time fly by so fast. As we enter middle age, I want to treasure every moment we have left on earth. I want every day to be fun, joyful and create meaningful memories together with G.

Our always clean and clutter free living room and my favorite corner in our big couch is my happy place. G recently did a deep cleaning of the couch and rug using a fabric cleaning machine which uses water and suction. I'm thankful G is so good at cleaning and genuinely enjoy cleaning, the way I enjoy cooking. We really are perfect compliments when it comes to cleaning and cooking. Today feels extra nice laying in that corner and hearing the rain outside.
