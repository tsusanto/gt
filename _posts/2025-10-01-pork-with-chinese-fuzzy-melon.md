* Braised pork with chinese fuzzy melon
* oyster mushrooms in miso butter sauce
* miso soup with tofu and seaweed
* kimchi (from Costco)

We ended our membership at the sports club and now play pickleball almost exclusively at the newly opened indoor pickleball club. We truly enjoyed our time at the sports club, and I’m thankful for the happy memories and friendships we made there.

At the indoor club, we’ve already found a regular group of friends, and I feel so grateful for this welcoming community.

Just yesterday, someone organized a surprise birthday party at noon for one of the members, and we were invited. I brought along some home made grilled lemongrass tri-tip to share.

Today marks the first heavy rain of the fall season. I often feel wistful when summer ends—how does time fly by so quickly? As G and I move through middle age, I want to treasure every moment we have together. For the entire time we've been together, I am grateful that most days have been filled with joy, fun and meaningful memories and I hope they will continue.

Our clean, clutter-free living room is my happy place. My favorite spot is the inside corner of our big L-shaped couch. Recently, G deep-cleaned both the couch and rug with a fabric cleaning machine. I’m thankful that G is so good at, and actually enjoys, cleaning the way I enjoy cooking. We truly complement each other in that way. Today feels especially cozy, lying in that corner and listening to the rain outside.
