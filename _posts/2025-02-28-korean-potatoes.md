Ingredients:
* 1 lb yukon gold potatoes, peeled and cubed
* 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
* 3 tablespoons low sodium soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon sugar
* 1 tablespoon honey
* 1 tablespoon sesame oil
* 1/2 cup water
* 1 clove garlic - finely minced
* sesame seeds 

Make the sauce with soy sauce, sugar, honey, sesame oil, garlic and water.

Peel and cube the potatoes. Soak in water for about 30 minutes to wash off some of the starch. Pan fry the potatoes on all sides until lightly browned. 

Pour the sauce into the pan and mix well. Put the lid on for about 5 minutes.

Remove the lid and cook off any remaining water. 

Sprinkle with sesame seeds. 

This dish can be eaten at room temperature so it's good to make a bigger batch to enjoy again the next day.
