We had such a wonderful Saturday!

Saturday was a lovely day with perfect temperature in the low 70s. We visited our local farmers market. It's our first time visiting and I'm so pleased with the vegetable selection and the amazing prices. We bought a lot of vegetables for $14. We ran into a pickleball acquaintance and his wife at the farmers market and had a small chat. Our town isn't very big and we often run into people we know.

We had lunch at home then visited a local winery less than 20 minutes drive from home. I'm so grateful we have easy access to a few charming small wineries without having to drive too far. They often have free live music or other fun events. It's our first time to this particular winery and we will definitely come back again.
