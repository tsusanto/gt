I woke up this morning well rested and feeling content. This house is such a joy to wake up to, Greg always keeps it so clean and clutter free. I often start my day with a 10 minute meditation, and some stretching. 

We are both lucky to have a fully remote chill jobs, which means we rarely feel rushed for the entire day, pretty much every day including weekdays. This to me is true luxury.


We overindulged last night on the pork belly with ssamjang wraps and beer, today a simple tofu soup with vegetables seemed like the perfect little lunch.

I love this locally made tofu, it's sold in a plastic bag filled with water, not too firm or soft, and very good tofu flavor. You can adjust the amount of the vegetables per your liking.

Ingredients:
* 1 pack of tofu 
* dashi packet (I use Kayanoya brand)
* daikon
* crysanthemum greens (tong ho)
* green onions
* white pepper 
* dried seaweed 

Boil some water with the dashi packet for 5 minutes. Discard the dashi packet. Add the rest of the ingredients, add salt and pepper to taste.
