* cherry tomatoes from our garden

I told G I wanted to start making meals the Japanese way, called ichiju sansai, which includes a main dish, two side dishes, and a soup. G found these beautiful bento plates at Crate & Barrel, and I’m absolutely thrilled with them. Eating dinner from ceramic plates definitely feels better than using a plastic bento box. He’s always so supportive of my little whims.

I’m also super excited and grateful that an indoor pickleball club finally opened in our town—today was the grand opening! G and I play a lot of pickleball, and since we both dislike being in the sun, this is perfect for us. The club has air conditioning, is open all day, every day, and will make such a positive impact on our lives. We even signed up for a founders membership before the place was finished being built.
