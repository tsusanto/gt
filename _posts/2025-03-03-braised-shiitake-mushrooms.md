I had a pretty perfect well balanced day today. Had a good night's rest, did some work, went for my favorite dance fitness class then made lunch. Worked a little bit more, meditated, did a quick stretch then an hour nap. Greg and I went to play pickleball, I had some very fun ladies games. Then I made a yummy dinner, and Greg ran a hot bath for me. I love our bathtub, it's the right size and always clean. 


I love fresh plump shiitake mushrooms. I get them at our local asian grocery store, and they always carry these fresh flower top shiitake mushrooms, which has white cracks in the mushroom caps. They are thicker and absorb flavors better than the regular shiitake mushrooms which you find at Costco.


Ingredients:
* 8-10 fresh shiitake mushrooms - thinly sliced
* 1 clove garlic - finely minced
* 1 tablespoons vegetable oil
* 1 tablespoon butter
* 1 tablespoon light low sodium soy sauce
* 1/2 teaspoon sugar
* 1 teaspoon sesame oil
* 1 tablespoon dark soy sauce
* 1/2 cup water


Stir fry garlic in vegetable oil and butter, add sliced mushrooms to pan. Stir fry for another 5 minutes. Add light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, sugar, sesame oil and stir fry for another 2 minutes.

Add water and cover pan. Turn stove to low heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove lid and stir fry until most of the liquid evaporates.
