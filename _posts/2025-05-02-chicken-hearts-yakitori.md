I am grateful for having such a chill fully remote job that gives me luxury of cooking fresh meals almost every lunch and dinner. 

We eat together at home almost every day, and it is one of the fun highlights of our daily lives. Greg always clean up after each meal and leave our kitchen spotlessly clean.

Greg is the biggest fan of my cooking and I am not afraid to try out any recipes. Even if he doesn't like a dish, which is pretty rare, he is always so positive and encouraging.

Today I decided to be adventurous and make yakitori style chicken hearts. Surprisingly we both loved it.
