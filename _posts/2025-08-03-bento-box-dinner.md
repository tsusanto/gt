We went to Dallas last weekend to watch a Pickleball Pro MLP tournament and we got to see all our favorite pro players in person. 

Dallas turned out to be a foodie trip. We enjoyed eating at a mediterranean buffet at Dimassi's Restaurant, had the best bbq I've ever had at Hard Eight BBQ. We also visited korean town in Carrolton, TX and had a really good korean lunch box togo from a place called MeatBanchan, which we brought to the pickleball tournament facility.

The pickleball pro tournament was such an amazing and memorable experience for both of us. It was held at Pickler Universe, a topnotch new pickleball facility. Unlike other pro sports, these pickleball pro players were walking around the facility like regular folks so it was very easy to ask them for autographs or take a photo. They are all so nice and friendly. 

The tournament sponsors gave out free generous samples of cocktails, wine and beer. We had many helpings of it and thoroughly enjoyed the drinks with our delicious korean bento box lunch. 

The korean bento box was so good it inspired me to make bento style meals at home, so I bought some bento boxes and used it at home for our meals.

Today is the first time I used them and it turned out well.

I'm really grateful to have nice neighbors. One of them gave us a big bunch of yard long beans they grew in their backyard and I used it in tonight's dinner.
