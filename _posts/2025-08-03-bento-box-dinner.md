We went to Dallas last weekend to watch a Pickleball Pro MLP tournament and we got to see all our favorite pro players in person. 

Dallas turned out to be a foodie trip. We enjoyed eating at a mediterranean buffet at Dimassi's Restaurant, had the best bbq I've ever had at Hard Eight BBQ. We also visited korean town in Carrolton, TX and had a really good korean lunch box togo from a place called MeatBanchan, which we brought to the pickleball tournament facility.

The pickleball pro tournament was such an amazing and memorable experience for both of us. It was such a new topnotch pickleball facility and unlike other pro sports, these pro players was walking around the facility like regular folks so it was very easy to ask them for autographs or take a photo. They are all so nice and friendly. 

They also had free generous samples of cocktails, wine and beer. We had many helpings of it and thoroughly enjoyed the drinks with our korean bento box with it. 

The korean bento box was so good it inspired me to make bento style meals at home too, so I bought some bento boxes and used it at home for our meals.

Today is the first time I used them and it turned out well.

I'm really grateful to have nice neighbors. One of them gave us a big bunch of yard long beans they grew in their backyard and I used it in tonight's dinner.

We had a huge success with our two cherry tomato plants this year, I've been able to harvest a pound of tomatoes every other day. They are very flavorful and I use it in my cooking everyday. 

We redid our backyard last year and put in one vegetable planter, it was a fun team effort in designing and hiring contractors to build it. G and I make a great team.
