We went to Dallas last weekend to watch a Pickleball Pro MLP tournament, where we got to see all our favorite pro players in person.

The trip also turned into a foodie adventure. We enjoyed a Mediterranean buffet at Dimassi’s Restaurant, had the best BBQ I’ve ever tasted at Hard Eight, and visited Korea Town in Carrollton, TX. There, we picked up a delicious Korean lunch box from MeatBanchan and brought it along to the tournament.

The tournament itself was such an amazing and memorable experience. It was held at Pickler Universe, a top-notch new pickleball facility. Unlike other professional sports, the players were walking around just like everyone else, making it easy to ask for autographs or take photos. Ben Johns and Tyra Black were both incredibly kind and friendly.

The sponsors added to the fun by handing out generous free samples of cocktails, wine, and beer. We happily enjoyed several rounds along with our Korean bento lunch.

That bento box was so good it inspired me to start making bento-style meals at home. I bought a set of bento boxes, and today was the first time I used them—it turned out great!

I’m also really grateful for our kind neighbors. One of them recently shared a big bunch of yard-long beans from their garden, and I used them in tonight’s dinner.
