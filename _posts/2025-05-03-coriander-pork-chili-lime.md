Marinate sliced pork with indonesian sweet soy sauce, generous amount of coriander powder, salt, black pepper, garlic powder.

Stir fry some finely chopped thai chili in a bit of oil, turn up heat and add marinated pork to the pan. Cook pork until slightly charred. Add more sweet soy sauce and stir fry for another minute.

Turn off heat and squeeze a generous amount of lime juice on the pork and mix well.

Garnish with cilantro and serve with plain jasmine rice.
